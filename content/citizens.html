  <h1>Those Most Affected</h1>
  <p>The last main stakeholder in the topic of foreign loaning is the citizens of countries that borrow money. These are the people that oftentimes are the most affected when a loan agreement is too much for the loanee to handle. This case arises when the loanee is desperate for money (such as after a disaster) or if the interest rate is too high. In any case, the citizens will always feel the effects of the agreement's  economic reprecussions.</p>

  <h1>What Affects These Views?</h1>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Foreign loans are often controversial topics among the country's citizens. Much like their leaders, loanee citizens have a variety of views on foreign investment in their country. Their views will usually depend on their level of cynicism about Capitalism, investment and the world around them. It can also hinge on their faith in their government.</p>

    <h1>So Why Against?</h1>
    <p>Many citizens can feel cheated when a foreign power coerces their govenrment into accepting an unfair loan. Such is the case with Zambians, who had elected Michal Sata into presidency. Sata ran on anti-China policies, which means he wanted to limit the Asian country's influence on Zambia's economy. Many Zambians felt like they were being taken advantage of by China, and wanted the manipulation to stop. Because of this, they supported a leader who stood firmly against Chinese investment in the country.</p>

    <h1>So Why For?</h1>
    <p>Many people just haven't lost faith in the world or their leaders. Some may be skeptical, but they still hold out hope for or believe that foreign investment will seriously improve their lives. There are after all multiple instances of this being the case. Many countries have gotten loans and gone one to be very successful. These citizens believe that although a lot of bad can come from accepting foreign aid or money, it can do some good too.</p>
