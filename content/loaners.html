  <p>Loaner entities in this case are always foreign countries or global banking institutions. They are business or banking types, mainly focused on opportunity and turning a profit. As such they have to consider the risk and reward of loaning large amounts of money to a country in need.</p>

    <h1>The Risk</h1>
    <p>All people who deal in investment must consider two fundamental concepts: risk and reward. Risk is the potential for an investment to end up without positive results for the investor. Investors consider risk before loaning money to a poorer country. They will oftentimes stipulate that certain actions be taken by the loanee as part of the loan agreement in order to minimize their risk.</p>
    <p>One recent example of this would be a loan the IMF made to Greece in summer 2017 (the countr's third bailout since 2010). The loan was granted only afte Greek leaders promised to implement extensive economic reforms. These reforms included streamlining the country's debt relief process for future use. This conditional loan isn't so bad, but others can impede on a country's sovereignty or disrupt their path of development. Countries that are poor and/or in debt are in need of outside funding and must take what they can get, even if it means being taken advantage of through conditional loaning.</p>

    <h1>The Reward</h1>
    <p>Reward in this case is the return investment: when money is loaned to a loanee, it is expected that that money plus interest be paid back over the course of a pre-determined timespan. This means that the loaner will eventually end up gaining more money than they gave away, leading to a net increase in wealth. This is the goal for all investors, it's how they make money. Penalties are in place for loanees who cannot pay back borrowed money.</p>
    <p>Countries who have just gone through a natural disaster (such as many Caribbean countries) are seen as a golden opportunity to investors. These countries are in desperate need of immediate cash to rebuild their infrastructure, so they'd enter into loan agreements with higher-than-average interest rates. This is great news to an investor because it means an uncommonly large increase in net wealth.</p>

  <h1>Special Interest and Exerting Influence</h1>
  <p>Investment is one way to exert influence on a large scale in the modern world. The age of empires is over. Dynasties are no longer built on the backs of warriors but on investors. Loaners are in the unique spot to give out money only if the loanee meets a set of special conditions. The loaner can put any condition into an agreement, depending on how desperate the loanee is. If the loaner has any special interests or wants the loanee to do something for them, thy can make it part of the agreement. The ability to define special conditions in a loan is amazing for the loaner. It gives them power over the loanee, who in this case is an entire country.</p>
  <p>Imagine having being able to manipulate an entire business, country or nation but without having to manage its day to day functions. You'd be like a king that rules from afar. This is the kind of power that is given to investors when they enter into a conditional loan with a loanee country.</p>

  <h1>The Verdict</h1>
  <p>Loans are nothing but positive for loaner entities. They lose a large sum of money in the short term but in the long run they get richer than they were before. They get to command the loanee to do whatever they want (assuming the loanee still signs the agreement). If the loanee cannot pay back their loaner, they be in debt and will continue to pay back money over a longer time period. They may even need to pull out another loan...</p>
  <p>Needless to say, loaning to foreign countries is nothing but a blessing for investors. The only loss they can sustain is not turning as big a profit as soon as they thought they would.</p>
