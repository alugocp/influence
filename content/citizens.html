  <h1>Those Most Affected</h1>
  <p>The last main stakeholder in the topic of foreign loaning is the citizens of countries that borrow money. These are the people that oftentimes are the most affected when a loan agreement is too much for the loanee to handle. This case arises when the loanee is desperate for money (such as after a disaster) or if the interest rate is too high. In any case, the citizens will always feel the effects of the loan agreement's economic reprecussions.</p>

  <h1>What Affects These Views?</h1>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Loans and investments between foreign entities are often controversial topics among either country's citizens. Much like their leaders, loanee citizens have a variety of views on foreign investment in their country. Their views will usually depend on their level of cynicism about Capitalism, investment and the world around them. It can also hinge on their faith in their government.</p>

    <h1>So Why For?</h1>
    <p>Many people just haven't lost faith in the world or in their leaders. Some may be skeptical, but they still hold out hope for or believe that foreign investment will seriously improve their lives. There are after all multiple instances of this being the case. Many countries have gotten loans and gone on to be very successful. These citizens believe that although a lot of bad can come from accepting foreign aid or money, it can do some good too.</p>
    <p>Kenya is developing a 472 km long <a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/China-defends-Kenya-SGR-debt/1056-3952474-14aagu9/index.html">standard gauge railway</a> to connect the cities of Nairobi and Mombasa with the help of the Chinese government. Some Kenyans are worried about adding more Yuan to their national debt, but others welcome the new railroad and all its prospective benefits. The train is expected to decrease congestion on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, for instance. Supplies from the Indian Ocean could reach the capital in a cheap and efficient manner, bolstering Kenya's economy and trade with Asian countries.</p>

    <h1>So Why Against?</h1>
    <p>Many citizens can feel cheated when a foreign power coerces their government into accepting an unfair loan. Such is the case with Zambians, who had <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-09-25/zambian-election-results-check-chinese-influence-africa">elected Michal Sata</a> into presidency. Sata ran on anti-China policies, which means he wanted to limit the Asian country's influence on Zambia's economy. Many Zambians felt like they were being taken advantage of by China, and wanted the manipulation to stop. Because of this, they supported a leader who stood firmly against Chinese investment in the country.</p>
    <h1>In Summary</h1>
    <p>Any action taken by a government will be seen from many different views by the country's citizens and borrowing foreign capital is no exception. Whoever the loaner, a loanee country will find its citizens split on whether any good will come from foreign interaction. There will always be a group of citizens who stand to benefit more than the rest. Everyone else in a country will either not care or will oppose borrowing loans from outside entities.</p>
