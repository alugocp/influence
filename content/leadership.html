    <h1>Two Types of Leaders</h1>
    <p>There are two main types of leaders in the world: <b>good</b> leaders and <b>bad</b> ones. Which category a given leader falls into will determine their views on foreign loans.</p>
    <p>For the most part, good leaders will be wary of foreign loans (especially when aggressive loaning techniques are used). Bad leaders are also for foreign loans, but it's always to get some sort of personal gain out of it.</p>

    <h1>Good Leaders</h1>
    <p>Good leaders will be careful when taking out a foreign loan. They have good intentions and usually some understanding of the possible consequences of borrowing large sums of money. Their hope is to better their country with loaned foreign funds. They will take care to ensure that their people do not suffer from any consequences of their borrowing money.</p>
    <p>These people see value and necessity in a country's ability to loan money from another. They will also see the down-sides and side-effect associated with this economic practice. Good leaders support the practice, but will also call for reforms or caution when dealing with it.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h1>Bad Leaders</h1>
    <p>A leader is considered bad for one of multiple reasons. One is potentially that they're corrupt. Another is that they do not make good on their campaign promises or that they are just unpopular with the majority of people in their country. Sometimes it's a mix of these possibilities. In any case, bad leaders tend to misuse (or fall for) one-sided foreign loaning agreements. These leaders often have little interest in doing their jobs or don't care if their constituents suffer from thei inability to run a country.</p>
