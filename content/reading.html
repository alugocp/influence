    <p>A small group of economists run experiments on businesses in Venezuela to find what effect foreign investment has on their growth. They conclude that businesses that are run as joint ventures with foreign entities grow much more than foreign-backed businesses that are owned by local figures. The economists in question apply the scientific method in an unbiased fashion in order to successfully determine the relation between two complex economic factors. The two authors do a lot of related research about the role investors play in markets around the world.

    <p>This article seeks to explain the general outcomes of foreign investment between international companies. For starters, this sort of direct investment results in a net change of capital between the countries that host these businesses. Companies that get loans to expand abroad oftentimes engage in horizontal expansion, where they produce the same goods as they do in their host country. The author is an American economist and professor of economics at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He has written many books on economics abroad, including investment between political bodies and multinational companies. Readers who have an interest in how companies that trade loans affect their countries' economies will want to read this article.

    <p>This article sought to investigate the effects of Greece's recent economic crises on their healthcare system and health technology. The study concluded that following the onset of Greece's economic crisis, the public health system deteriorated. Other findings were that the levels of suicides and epidemics increased, the former resulting from mass debt and the latter from an eroded healthcare system. Greek hospitals suddenly found themselves unable to afford to treat patients and mental health institutes could no longer stay open. The authors who conducted this study investigated multiple facets of the crippled Greek health system and researched statistics from official records in order to come to a conclusion on the state of the country's public health system. Readers interested in the disastrous potential of an economic crisis or in the fate of Greece before their bailout will want to check out this study.</p>

    <p>This article examines the economic crisis of 1990's Jamaica in an attempt to design an economic system that can withstand periodic instability. They specifically look at the weakening of Jamaica from hurricanes in the very late 20th century and how that contributed to the island nation's national debt. From there they decide on how to run an economic system that can handle periodic destruction from tropical storms and such. Such a system would work wonders in any Caribbean country, seeing as most of their current economic crises come from the occasional hurricane or other natural disaster. Readers interested in economic policy will definitely want to read this article, as it is all about designing an economic system tailored specifically to Jamaica's needs. Readers interested in learning more about Jamaica's history of debt will also find this article fascinating, as it takes a closer look into the island's history with predatory loans and economic hardships.</p>

  <p>Although not mentioned on this site, India has a very colorful history of predatory loans and economic hardships imposed upon them by the legacy of British colonization. In many ways they share a similar story to Jamaica. This article seeks to design an economic policy for agricultural investment that can utilize rural farmers in India. The policy will take advantage of the low-income rural areas already present in much of India today. The design is modeled after data gathered from low-income households around the country. The author Kenneth I. Wolpin is a professor of economics at Rice University. He is an expert on economic policy and how it can utilize the currently untapped potential of local labor and resources. He channels this knowledge as he designs an agricultural economic policy for India that would require little foreign investment to implement. Readers interested in economic policy will want to look at this article.</p>
