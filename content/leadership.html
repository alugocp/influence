    <h1>Who?</h1>
    <p>Loan agreements are negotiated and signed between two groups: the people giving away the loan and the people receiving it. In investment between countries, the people receiving loans are not the citizens of the loanee country, but rather the country's leaders. How a leader feels about foreign investment depends on many factors. The economic condition of their country, how corrupt they may be and previous experience with investors all play into their position on foreign loans.</p>

          <p>There are multiple reasons for why a leader would support foreign investment. They will be for it if they stand to gain advantage from foreign loans or if they do not care how other leaders handle their economies. Many examples of leaders being for foreign investments can be seen in the UN's decision to bail out Greece. The countries that helped forge the agreement decided to force the loanee to implement serious economic reforms. These countries that contributed to the loan (European countries) stood to benefit in that they could ensure that the price of the Euro would stay up. They run on this currency too, so it has impact on them as well as Greece.</p>
          <p>Other leaders might have different reasons for being for foreign investment. Many African leaders are eager to loan money and workers from Chinese companies in hopes of boosting their economies and infrastructure.</p>

    <h1>Against Foreign Loans</h1>
    <p>There are various reasons for a leader to be against borrowing foreign money. They may want be pursuing isolationist ideologies or they fear the influence a wealthier country may have on their own. Perhaps they see foreign investment as agressive loans and nothing more. Whatever the case, here are a few examples of leaders who do not like to borrow foreign money:</p>
    <p><b>Kim Jong Un: </b>Pre-WW2 Korea was always known in the West as the "Hermit Kingdom" since they interacted as little as possible with the outside world. The southern half of the nation left this pursuit in favor of globalization's benefits after the Korean War, but their Communist counterparts decided to keep few ties outside of the peninsula. The North Korean government, while a member of the UN, does not foster good relations with most other countries in the world. On top of that, their government teaches their citizens that the outside world is pure evil and full of enemies of the state. Their illusions may shatter if they take loans from other governments.</p>
    <p><b>Nícoas Maduro:</b> The current president of Venezuela Nícolas Maduro refuses foreign aid such as food supplies from the U.S. and his neighbors. This is despite the fact that Peru established the trade bloc Mercosur against the country. Maduro faces opposition both from his citizens and from congress, and has made several bold power moves in the past few years to stay on top of it all. The last thing he wants is foreign influence diluting his power, no matter the costs to his citizens.</p>
