    <h1>The Main Issue</h1>
    <p>In the world today there exists richer countries and poorer countries. Sometimes the economic divide between these two groups are staggering. Wealthier countries enjoy more advanced technology, medicine and entertainment while poorer countries deal mainly with outdated versions. Both countries get to enjoy sovereignty...or do they?</p>
    <p>Poorer countries often find themselves needing to pull out loans to recover from natural disasters or implement economic reforms. They usually go the the International Money Fund (IMF) or to wealthier countries. Before a loan can be succesfully pulled out, an agreement must be struck between the leadership of the country that wants the loan and the leadership that will give the loan. Every time this happens, the person giving the loan will demand certain political or economic actions be taken by the country borrowing money.</p>
    <p>For example, when Jamaica borrowed money to rebuild afte hurricane Sandy, the IMF stipulated that they open their trade to receive foreign goods. Local markets and the island's economy crashed as a result.</p>

    Loaner entities are leadership from wealthier countries or the IMF...basically anyone who would loan money to a poorer country.

    These are the people who run a poorer country. They might be politicians or businesspeople. They are the ones asking for a loan, whether it be to make a positive difference for their people, to expand their own influence or for some corrupt purpose.

    These are the people who are most vulnerable to the process of foreign loans. They will feel its effects on the local economy first and more than any other group.
