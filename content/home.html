    <h1>The Main Issue</h1>
    <p>In the world today there exists richer countries and poorer countries. Sometimes the economic divide between these two groups are staggering. Wealthier countries enjoy more advanced technology, medicine and entertainment while poorer countries are left with outdated versions of each. The great equalizer is that both countries get to enjoy sovereignty over themselves...or do they?</p>
    <p>Poorer countries often find themselves needing to pull out loans to recover from natural disasters or implement economic reforms. They usually go the the International Money Fund (IMF) or to wealthier countries. Before a loan can be succesfully pulled out, an agreement must be struck between the leadership of the country that wants the loan and the leadership that will give the loan. Every time this happens, the group giving the loan will demand certain political or economic actions be taken by the country borrowing money.</p>
    <p>For example, Jamaica has had to borrow money <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/16/jamaica-decades-debt-damaging-future">countless times</a> following tropical storms and economic disasters, the latter of which goes back to before the island's independence from Britain. Each time the nation takes out a loan, the IMF seizes the opportunity to impose economic structural changes on it. The IMF once forced Jamaica to open themselves up to foreign trade after a particularly devastating hurricane, stamping out local markets in the process.</p>

    Loaner entities are leadership from wealthier countries or the IMF...basically anyone who would loan money to a poorer country.

    These are the people who run a poorer country. They might be politicians or business people. They are the ones asking for a loan, whether it be to make a positive difference for their people, to expand their own influence or for some corrupt purpose.

    These are the people who are most vulnerable to the process of foreign loaning. They will feel its effects on the local economy first and more intensely than any other group.
